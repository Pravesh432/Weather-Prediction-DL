# Weather-Prediction-DL
Using ANN(Artificial Neural Network) created model for Weather prediction

# Problem Statement: 
- This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more. Predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.

# About Dataset:
- I got the Weather DataSet from the Kaggle website
- In these dataset there are 145460 Rows and 23 Columns mens Features so as we can see Its huge amount of data so I used Deep learning to Predict the weather.
